This repository contains the **client** for the main project, an **e-commerce platform for games**, developed during the [React Avan√ßado](https://reactavancado.com.br/) course, which teaches advanced React concepts while building a complete e-commerce platform. The project focuses on creating a game sales platform with an optimized shopping experience, authentication, e-commerce features, payments, and much more.

## üöÄ Requirements

To run the Client, you need to have the API pre-configured on your machine.
This client project consumes the WonGames API, available in the [wongames-api](https://github.com/pedroestevaodev/wongames-api) repository. The API provides dynamic data such as games, categories, and payment information.

- **API Repository (e-commerce backend):** [WonGames API](https://github.com/pedroestevaodev/wongames-api)
- **FIGMA DESIGN:** [WonGames Design](https://www.figma.com/design/ovvUTvKUFwLzOlU2LNmohM/Won-Games-English?node-id=43-1&p=f&t=5FZQegZOJjGpufOd-0)

## üîß Setup and Installation

### 1Ô∏è. Install dependencies:
```bash
$ pnpm install
```

### 2Ô∏è. Create the `.env` file

Create an `.env` file in the root of the project, or edit if it already exists, similar to the following structure:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://localhost:1337"
NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_SCHEMA="http://localhost:1337/graphql"
AUTH_URL="http://127.0.0.1:3000"
AUTH_SECRET="tobemodified"
APPLICATION_URL="http://127.0.0.1:3000"
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="tobemodified"
NODE_ENV="tobemodified"
```

## üì¶ What‚Äôs Included?

This project includes everything you need to start working on the game e-commerce frontend. Key features include:

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Integration with Auth.js for login and session management.
- **UI Components**: Build reusable and testable components with React and Styled Components.
- **Testing**: Automated tests using Jest and React Testing Library, along with API tests using MSW.
- **Component Visualization**: Develop isolated components using Storybook.
- **API Integration**: Consumes the e-commerce game API, using Apollo Client and GraphQL for communication.

## üìú Commands

To run the development server locally, just execute the following command:

```bash
$ pnpm run dev
```

Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the project in action.

You can start editing the homepage by modifying the `app/page.tsx` file. The browser will automatically update as you make changes to the code.

Here are the main commands available for the project:

- `dev`: Starts the application in development mode on localhost:3000.
- `build`: Creates a production version of the application.
- `start`: Starts a simple server with the production code.
- `lint`: Runs the linter on all project files.
- `typecheck`: Check for type errors according to the configuration in the `tsconfig.json` file.
- `test`: Runs Jest tests for the application. The --passWithNoTests flag ensures that Jest doesn't fail if no tests are found.
- `test:watch`: Runs automated tests with Jest in watch mode.
- `test:ci`: Runs Jest tests in Continuous Integration (CI) mode, ensuring tests run serially (--runInBand) for better debugging and no parallelization.
- `generate`: Runs Plop.js, a tool for code generation, using the plopfile.js configuration to create files or templates.
- `storybook`: Starts Storybook to visualize components on localhost:6006.
- `build-storybook`: Creates the production version of Storybook.
- `codegen`: Runs the GraphQL Code Generator to generate types and other code based on the GraphQL queries defined in the project, using the configuration defined in codegen.ts.
- `prepare`: Installs and sets up Git hooks with Husky, which allows you to enforce rules and scripts before committing or pushing code (e.g., running linters or tests before commit).
